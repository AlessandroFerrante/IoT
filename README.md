# IoT üåêüí°
University course: Internet of Things

## Description
This repository contains all the protocols and assignments completed during the IoT course at the University. 
The course covers various aspects of the design and programming of the protocols, with particular attention to the Arduino-Nano-ESP32, together with additional components in order to take advantage of various protocols.

### Protocols
1. [WiFi Protocol](https://github.com/AlessandroFerrante/Embedded-Systems/blob/main/WiFi%20Protocol/)
2. [ESP-NOW Protocol]((https://github.com/AlessandroFerrante/Embedded-Systems/blob/main/ESP-NOW%20Protocol/))

Each protocol folder contains the source code implementation of the protocols with related examples.

## Requirements
- Visual Studio Code with the [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/);
- `iot_board` library provided by the course to implement the protocols using the components with Arduino Nano Esp32;
